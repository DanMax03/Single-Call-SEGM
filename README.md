# Single-Call-SEGM
The purpose of the repository is to fix my analysis of the article ["On the Convergence of Single-Call Stohastic Extra-Gradient Methods"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08465) and share it with others.

The analysis is done as an additional part of the course "Optimization Methods" at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), so it is done in Russian language.
